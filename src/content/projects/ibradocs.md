Ongoing documentation work for the IBRACORP community, aimed at making Unraid and homelab workflows easier to follow and recover.

- Adds and refines guides with explicit pre-reqs, rollback steps, and screenshots where clarity matters most.
- Reviews contributions through a reliability lens so readers have guardrails for upgrades and backups.
- Keeps terminology consistent between related guides to reduce onboarding friction.
