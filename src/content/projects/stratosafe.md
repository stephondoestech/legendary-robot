Personal project experimenting with a low-touch backup orchestrator for servers and services I care about.

- Emphasizes recoverability over storage tricks: checklists for capture, verify, and restore.
- Favors simple configuration and observability so failures surface quickly.
- Intended to integrate with existing tooling rather than replace it.
