# 2024: A Year of Growth, Connection, and Discovery

As I reflect on 2024, I'm struck by how this year has been defined by meaningful connections - to family, to work, to self-understanding, and to purpose. Each month brought its own challenges and triumphs, weaving together into a tapestry of growth that I couldn't have predicted when the year began.

## Professional Evolution

At The New York Times, 2024 was marked by the weight of responsibility and the joy of collaboration. Throughout the year, our team shouldered the critical task of ensuring our election-related news infrastructure remained robust and reliable. Every test, every late night, and every contingency plan was driven by our commitment to keeping the public informed during crucial moments of democracy.

The formation of our new team has been nothing short of remarkable. What started as a group of talented individuals quickly evolved into a cohesive unit, building trust not just among ourselves but earning the confidence of teams across the organization. Watching my Staff engineers step into their roles as technical leaders has been particularly gratifying - their synchronization with the team and broader organization showcases the power of empowered technical leadership.

My business, StephonDoesTech, took an meaningful turn this year by focusing on supporting small non-profits with their MDM needs. This alignment of technical expertise with social impact represents exactly the kind of work I've always hoped to do - using technology to empower organizations doing vital community work.

## Personal Growth and Family Bonds

This year brought profound changes on the personal front. Watching my daughter start daycare was both heart-wrenching and beautiful. Her transformation from tentative newcomer to confident little person has been amazing to witness. Every new friend made, every skill learned, and every story shared has been a reminder of her developing personality and independence.

None of this would have been possible without my incredible wife Christina. Her unwavering support during countless late nights and unexpected work emergencies has been the foundation of our family's stability. Our relationship has deepened through these challenges, growing stronger through each shared triumph and obstacle.

## Family Dreams and Friendship

One of this year's brightest highlights was supporting my sister as she realized her dream of opening a fresh produce market on Buffalo's East Side. This venture represents more than just a business - it's about bringing vital resources to our community and watching a long-held dream take tangible form.

My friend Stephanie's journey to Thailand was a reminder of the beauty of fearless exploration. Watching her embrace new experiences with such natural grace has been inspiring, pushing me to consider how I might step out of my own comfort zones.

## Professional Mentorship and Personal Understanding

Kelly, my manager and friend, has been instrumental in my growth this year. Her guidance helped me push past self-imposed limitations and discover capabilities I hadn't recognized in myself. The impact of having someone who believes in you, challenges you, and supports you cannot be overstated.

Perhaps the most transformative personal development has been making peace with my childhood through the lens of my AuADHD diagnosis. Finding the right medication has been life-changing, bringing clarity and calm to aspects of life that once felt chaotic. This understanding has helped me not just accept my past but embrace how it shaped who I am today.

## Looking Forward

As 2024 draws to a close, I'm filled with gratitude for the growth, challenges, and connections that defined this year. From the technical challenges at the Times to the personal victories at home, each experience has contributed to a year of profound development and understanding.

The future feels bright with possibility, built on the foundation of strong family bonds, meaningful work, and deeper self-awareness. Here's to carrying forward the lessons, love, and growth from this transformative year into whatever challenges and opportunities await in 2025.
